## Get started

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ntegrals/december
   ```

2. Configure your AI provider in the `config.ts` file

   December supports multiple AI providers. You have several options:

   ### Option 1: Use Ollama (Local, No API Key Required) - Recommended for Getting Started

   ```typescript
   export const config = {
     aiSdk: {
       provider: "ollama", // No API key needed!
     },
   };
   ```

   **To use Ollama:**
   1. Install Ollama from [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
   2. Run: `ollama pull llama3.1:8b` (or any other model)
   3. Start December - it will work immediately!

   ### Option 2: Use Cloud Providers (Requires API Key)

   **For Anthropic (Best Code Quality):**
   ```typescript
   // In config.ts, update the anthropic provider:
   anthropic: {
     apiKey: "sk-ant-your-api-key-here", // Replace with your actual API key
   }

   // Then set the provider:
   export const config = {
     aiSdk: {
       provider: "anthropic",
     },
   };
   ```

   **For OpenAI:**
   ```typescript
   // In config.ts, update the openai provider:
   openai: {
     apiKey: "sk-your-api-key-here", // Replace with your actual API key
   }

   // Then set the provider:
   export const config = {
     aiSdk: {
       provider: "openai",
     },
   };
   ```

   **For Groq (Fast & Free tier available):**
   ```typescript
   // In config.ts, update the groq provider:
   groq: {
     apiKey: "gsk_your-api-key-here", // Replace with your actual API key
   }

   // Then set the provider:
   export const config = {
     aiSdk: {
       provider: "groq",
     },
   };
   ```

   ### Getting API Keys:
   - **Anthropic**: [https://console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
   - **OpenAI**: [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - **Groq**: [https://console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
   - **Google AI**: [https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - **OpenRouter**: [https://openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)

3. **No Docker Required!** üéâ

   December now uses CodeSandbox for instant project creation and hosting. No need to install or configure Docker!

4. Run the start script to set up the environment

   ```sh
   sh start.sh
   ```

5. The application will start in development mode, and you can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

   The backend will run on port 4000, and the frontend will run on port 3000.

   You can now start building your applications with December! ü•≥

## AI Provider Recommendations

### For Getting Started (No API Key Required)
- **Ollama** - Run models completely locally, no data leaves your machine, no costs

### For Best Code Quality
- **Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet** - Excellent at following instructions and generating clean code
- **OpenAI GPT-4o** - Great overall performance with good coding capabilities

### For Speed
- **Groq** - Ultra-fast inference with Llama models (free tier available)
- **Fireworks AI** - Fast inference with competitive pricing

### For Privacy/Local Use
- **Ollama** - Run models completely locally, no data leaves your machine

### For Cost-Effectiveness
- **OpenRouter** - Access to multiple models with competitive pricing
- **Together AI** - Good performance at lower costs

## Troubleshooting

### "API key required" Error
If you see an error like "API key required for provider 'anthropic' but not configured":

1. Open `config.ts`
2. Find your chosen provider in the `AI_PROVIDERS` object
3. Replace the empty `apiKey: ""` with your actual API key
4. Or switch to Ollama which doesn't require an API key:
   ```typescript
   provider: "ollama"
   ```

### Ollama Setup
1. Install Ollama: [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.1:8b`
3. Verify it's running: `ollama list`
4. Set provider to "ollama" in config.ts

## Motivation

AI-powered development platforms have revolutionized how we build applications. They allow developers to go from idea to working application in seconds, but most solutions are closed-source or require expensive subscriptions.

Until recently, building a local alternative that matched the speed and capabilities of platforms like Loveable, Replit, or Bolt seemed challenging. The recent advances in AI and cloud development environments like CodeSandbox have made it possible to build a fast, accessible development environment that gives you full control over your code and API usage.

I would love for this repo to become the go-to place for people who want to run their own AI-powered development environment. I've been working on this project for a while now and I'm really excited to share it with you.

## Why use December with CodeSandbox?

Building applications shouldn't require expensive subscriptions or complex local setup. December gives you the power of platforms like Loveable, Replit, and Bolt with the convenience of CodeSandbox:

- **No Local Setup Required** - No Docker installation, no complex configuration. Just run and start building
- **Instant Project Creation** - Projects are created instantly on CodeSandbox with live preview
- **Your API Keys, Your Costs** - Use your own API keys and pay only for what you use. No monthly subscriptions
- **Complete Feature Access** - No paywalls, premium tiers, or artificial limitations
- **Multiple AI Providers** - Choose from 11+ AI providers including local options like Ollama
- **Live Collaboration** - Share your CodeSandbox projects easily with others

Most cloud-based AI development platforms charge $20-100+ per month while limiting your usage. With December, a $5 API credit can generate dozens of complete applications, and you can share and collaborate on them instantly through CodeSandbox.

The CodeSandbox integration means you get instant deployment, live preview, and easy sharing without any infrastructure management. Your development environment is accessible from anywhere with just a browser.

December proves that you don't need to choose between powerful AI assistance and ease of use. Run it locally, use your own API keys, and build without boundaries.
